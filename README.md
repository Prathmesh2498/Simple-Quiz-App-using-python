# Simple-Quiz-App-using-python

This is a simple quiz app in python. <br>
For front end I have used Tkinter and the questions are loaded as a csv file. <br> This app requires each question to have 4 options and one correct answer.
<br> I made this to use for practice for my Final year engineering exams, which were conducted online due to COVID.
